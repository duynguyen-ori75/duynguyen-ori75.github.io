## What is the Virtual Database Engine of SQLite

Check [SQLite VDBE](https://sqlite.org/vdbe.html)

In short, it is an engine to execute the bytecode generated by the SQL processor in a virtual machine. The VDBE is the heart of SQLite, as occurs in the middle of the processing stream of SQLite:

### Where are the Operation codes of VDBE

Documents about Opcode can be found here: https://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html

After compiling SQLite, in the build folder, there will be two files: `opcodes.h` and `opcodes.c`. All the operation names and their codes will be placed in both files.
