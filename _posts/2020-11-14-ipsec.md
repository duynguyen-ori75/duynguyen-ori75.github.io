## Overview

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a security protocol for the network layer (in OSI model), which authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).

IPsec works for both IPv4 and IPv6

## Security architecture

IPsec uses the following protocols to perform various functions:

- Authentication Headers (AH)
- Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP)
- Security Associations (SA)

### Authentication Headers

This protocol provides connection-less data integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams and provides protection against replay attacks. AH operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 51.

The format of an AH packet is described below:

- `Next Header` (1 byte): Type of the next header, indicating what upper-layer protocol was protected. The value is taken from the [list of IP protocol numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers)
- `Payload Len` (1 byte): The length of this Authentication Header in 4-octet units, minus 2
- `Reserved` (2 bytes): Reserved for future use (all zeroes until then)
- `Security Parameters Index` (4 bytes): Arbitrary value which is used (together with the destination IP address) to identify the security association of the receiving party
- `Sequence Number` (4 bytes): A monotonic strictly increasing sequence number (incremented by 1 for every packet sent) to prevent replay attacks
- `Integrity Check Value` (multiple of 4 bytes): Variable length check value

### Encapsulating Security Payload

This protocol provides confidentiality, connectionless data integrity, data origin authentication, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and limited traffic-flow confidentiality.

Unlike Authentication Header (AH), ESP in transport mode does not provide integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet. However, in Tunnel Mode, where the entire original IP packet is encapsulated with a new packet header added, ESP protection is afforded to the whole inner IP packet (including the inner header) while the outer header (including any outer IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers) remains unprotected.

ESP operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 50.

Below is the format of an ESP packet:

![AH packet format](/assets/IPsec-esp-format.png)

- `Security Parameters Index` (4 bytes): Arbitrary value used (together with the destination IP address) to identify the security association of the receiving party
- `Sequence Number` (4 bytes): A monotonically increasing sequence number (incremented by 1 for every packet sent) to protect against replay attacks
- `Payload data` (variable): The protected contents of the original IP packet, including any data used to protect the contents. The type of content that was protected is indicated by the `Next Header` field
- `Padding` (0 to 255 bytes): Padding for encryption, to extend the payload data to a size that fits the encryption's cipher block size, and to align the next field
- `Pad Length` (1 byte): The number of bytes in the preceding `Padding` field
- `Next Header` (1 byte): Type of the next header. The value is taken from the [list of IP protocol numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers)
- `Integrity Check Value` (variable): Variable length check value, resulting from the application of the optional ESP authentication algorithm

## IPSec Key Exchange

IPSec, like many secure networking protocol sets, is based on the concept of a `shared secret` - two devices that want to send information securely encode and decode it using a piece of information that only they know. The primary support protocol used for exchanging that `secret` in IPSec is called `Internet Key Exchange` (IKE)

IKE includes cryptographic keys used for encoding authentication information and performing payload encryption. The first framework to provide IKE functionality is `Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol` (ISAKMP)

In VPN, IKE allows the VPN peers at both ends of the tunnel to encrypt and decrypt packets using mutually agreed-upon keys or certificate and method of encryption

### IKE Operation

There are two phases in **ISAKMP phased negotiation process**

- `ISAKMP Phase 1`: The first phase is a “setup” stage where two devices agree on how to exchange further information securely. This negotiation between the two units creates a security association for ISAKMP itself; an ISAKMP SA. This security association is then used for securely exchanging more detailed information in Phase 2.
- `ISAKMP Phase 2`: In this phase, the ISAKMP SA established in Phase 1 is used to create SAs for other security protocols. Normally, this is where the parameters for the real SAs for the AH and ESP protocols would be negotiated.

The main reason that IKE operation is separated into two phases is that the `ISAKMP Phase 2` can be conducted multiple times, which amortizes the extra “cost” of the two-phase approach

The ISAKMP security association negotiated during Phase 1 includes the negotiation of the following attributes used for subsequent negotiations:
- An encryption algorithm to be used, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
- A hash algorithm (MD5 or SHA, as used by AH or ESP).
- An authentication method, such as authentication using previously shared keys.
- A Diffie-Hellman group - In this method, asymmetric-key cryptography is used instead
