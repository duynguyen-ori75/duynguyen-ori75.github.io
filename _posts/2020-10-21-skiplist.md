title: Skip List data structure

## Definition

A skip list is an ordered data structure providing expected O(log(n)) lookup, insertion, and deletion complexity. It provides this level of efficiency without the need for complex tree balancing or page splitting like that required by B-trees, Red-Black trees, or AVL trees. As a result, itâ€™s a much simpler and more concise data structure to implement.

### Naive implementation - SkipListPointers

There are many ways to implement a skip list. A naive one is to implement it based on the above visualization. In other words, each box will be simply a pointer, which points to a data structure containing information such as:

- The address of the upper box
- The address of the lower box
- The address of the right box
- The `(key, value)` pair of the current box

```go
type Node struct {
  up    *Node
  down  *Node
  right *Node
  key   int
  value int
}

type SkipListPointers struct {
  maxLevel int
  head     *Node
}
```

This is quite straight forward, as you can simply travel from the top-left box of the Skip list to the correct position, and do whatever the operation is (`search`, `insert`, `remove`).

### Better implementation - SkipList using an array of next pointers

From the visualization, a quick thought is that all boxes that have the same key can be packed together in the same data structure. This means, we can simply have a list of data structures, each column contains information about the `(key, value)` pair, the height of that column, and a list of pointers to the next data structure based on the index.

The structs would look like below:

```go
type Node struct {
  key     int
  value   int
  height  int
  next    []*Node
}

type SkipList struct {
  root *Node
}
```

When doing a search operation, we can travel from the left-most column (which is the `head` column), check the `key` of each right pointer of the current box and travel to the next column if the next `key` is ok. Below is the implementation of the search operation:

```go
func (list *SkipList) searchNode(key int) *Node {
  node, currentHeight := list.root, list.root.height
  for node != nil {
    for ; currentHeight >= 0; currentHeight-- {
      for node.next[currentHeight] != nil && node.next[currentHeight].key <= key {
        node = node.next[currentHeight]
      }
    }
    if currentHeight < 0 {
      break
    }
  }
  return node
}
```

Why this is better? The answer is simple. In the previous implementation, each box will be stored on the random address of the process heap, which means that all travel operations can not utilize the CPU cache - caching nearby values of the current address. For the latter one, while right-travel operations remain the same, there is no longer down-travel operation, and the values inside a column can be loaded fully (depends on the size of the struct) into the CPU cache.
